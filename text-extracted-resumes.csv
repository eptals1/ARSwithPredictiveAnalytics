Re: TLE Teacher
Dear Ma’am,
I’m writing this letter to express my motivation to apply for the position of TLE Teacher in
Philippine Electronics and Communication Institute of Technology.
I’m a graduate of Bachelor of Technical Vocational Teacher Education—Major in Automotive
Technology at Caraga State University Cabadbaran Campus. I recently passed the Licensure
Examination for Teachers last September 2024. During my studies, I gained practical experience
through internships at Cabadbaran City National High School, where I developed lesson plans,
facilitated engaging classroom activities, and worked closely with students to support their
academic growth and personal development. These experiences have strengthened my ability to
connect with students, adapt to diverse learning styles, and maintain an inclusive and respectful
classroom environment. I am confident enough that I could contribute to the best of my ability to
the school’s vision of producing excellent quality students and graduates.
